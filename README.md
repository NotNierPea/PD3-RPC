# PD3-RPC
a Discord RPC for Payday 3, using dumper-v7 to get info and stuff. also my second project with a dumped sdk so code might be dogshit.

# Building
Compile in release, never debug, to update the SDK, you can use [Dumper-V7](https://github.com/Encryqed/Dumper-7).

# TODO?
- #### improve some low quality images of heists in discord dev
- #### fix random crash that happen if you close the game (rare)
- #### pre-planning screen smash and grab check
- #### improve shit i guess
